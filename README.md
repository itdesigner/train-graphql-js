# graphql-starwars

This is an example GraphQL server using the Star Wars data bundled with Facebook's reference implementation, [GraphQL.js](https://github.com/facebook/graphql/blob/master/README.md). It is built with express, node.js, and ES6.

# Run

    cd graphql-starwars
    npm install
    npm start

You will now have a GraphQL endpoint at [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/). If you visit the URL using a browser, you will see a live [GraphiQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql) IDE which you can use for querying. The same URL also serves as a JSON endpoint for graphql queries.
